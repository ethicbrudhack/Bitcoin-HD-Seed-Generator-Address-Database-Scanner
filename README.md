# 🌱 Bitcoin HD Seed Generator & Address Database Scanner

> ⚠️ **For Educational & Ethical Research Use Only**  
> This project demonstrates **multi-process generation of BIP39 seed phrases**  
> and real-time checking of derived **Bitcoin HD wallet addresses** against a local database.  
>  
> It is designed to explore wallet derivation standards (BIP44 / BIP49 / BIP84)  
> and database integration under multiprocessing workloads.  
>  
> **Do not use this tool for unauthorized wallet recovery or brute-force attempts.**

## 🚀 Overview

This Python script continuously generates or streams valid **BIP39 seed phrases** (12 or 24 words),  
derives corresponding addresses using the **BIP44**, **BIP49**, and **BIP84** standards,  
and verifies them against an SQLite address database (`addresses1111.db`).

When a match is found, the seed phrase and derived private keys are saved to `found_seeds.txt`.

The program supports:
- ⚙️ **Parallel multiprocessing**
- 🔁 **Seed deduplication with SQLite caching**
- 🧩 **BIP39 → BIP44 / BIP49 / BIP84 derivations**
- 📊 **Real-time progress counter**
- 💾 **Persistent hit logging**

| 🔄 **Alternating 12 / 24-word mode** | Alternates between 12 and 24 words for variety |
| ⚙️ **HD wallet derivation** | Generates addresses for BIP44, BIP49, and BIP84 |
| 💾 **SQLite seed memory** | Saves generated seeds to avoid duplicates |
| 🧩 **Address verification** | Checks addresses against local BTC database |
| 🧮 **Parallel processing** | Uses multiple CPU cores for concurrent scanning |
| 📈 **Live statistics** | Displays total seeds checked every few seconds |
| 🪙 **Donation reminder** | Optional display of a BTC donation address for support |

## 📂 File Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `main.py` | Main program file |
| `wordlist.txt` | BIP39 English word list |
| `addresses1111.db` | SQLite database containing known BTC addresses |
| `generated_seeds.db` | SQLite cache of generated seed phrases |
| `found_seeds.txt` | Output log for successful address matches |
| `README.md` | Documentation (this file) |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| `OUTPUT_FILE` | Output file for storing successful matches |
| `WORDLIST_FILE` | Path to BIP39 wordlist file |
| `PROCESSES` | Number of parallel processes to spawn |
| `USE_RANDOM` | If `True`, generate seeds by random selection from wordlist |
| `ALTERNATE_12_24` | Toggle alternating between 12-word and 24-word seeds |
| `DONATE_ADDRESS` | Optional Bitcoin address displayed upon match |

**Dependencies**


pip install mnemonic bip-utils base58 ecdsa bech32 psutil

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Load Database and Wordlist  
- Loads the **address database** (`addresses1111.db`) for live queries  
- Optionally loads the **BIP39 wordlist** from `wordlist.txt`  
- Skips RAM pre-loading to minimize memory usage

---

### 2️⃣ Seed Stream Generation  
The script alternates between **12** and **24-word** seeds for entropy.  
Seeds are either randomly sampled from the BIP39 list or fully generated by `mnemonic`.

```python
mnemo = Mnemonic("english")
phrase = mnemo.generate(strength=128 if num_words == 12 else 256)


Each generated seed is saved to generated_seeds.db for deduplication.

3️⃣ HD Wallet Derivation

For every valid seed, the script derives addresses from:

BIP44 – Legacy (1…)

BIP49 – Nested SegWit (3…)

BIP84 – Native SegWit (bc1…)

bip44_m = Bip44.FromSeed(seed_bytes, Bip44Coins.BITCOIN)
addr44 = bip44_m.Purpose().Coin().Account(0).Change(Bip44Changes.CHAIN_EXT).AddressIndex(0)


Each derivation also provides the corresponding private key integer.

4️⃣ Address Verification

Each derived address is checked in real-time against addresses1111.db:

cursor.execute("SELECT 1 FROM addresses WHERE address = ?", (address,))


When a match occurs, all relevant data are written to found_seeds.txt.

5️⃣ Multiprocessing & Progress Counter

Multiple workers (PROCESSES) generate and test seeds in parallel

A background thread prints global statistics every 2 seconds:

[⏱️] Total seeds checked: 482

🧩 Core Components
Function	Description
generate_seed_stream()	Continuously produces new BIP39 seed phrases
generate_hd_addresses()	Derives addresses for BIP44/BIP49/BIP84
address_exists_in_db()	Queries local SQLite BTC address database
save_seed_to_db()	Stores generated seeds to avoid duplicates

⚡ Performance Tips

Use SSD storage for SQLite databases.

Disable USE_RANDOM for pure mnemonic entropy generation.

Adjust PROCESSES to your CPU’s core count.

Run from a terminal with flush=True output enabled.

Ensure the wordlist (wordlist.txt) is complete and properly encoded.

🔒 Ethical & Legal Notice

This project is for educational, cryptographic, and security-research use only.
It demonstrates wallet derivation, multiprocessing design, and database integration.

You must not:

Attempt unauthorized wallet recovery or key scanning.

Use it on mainnet data that you do not own.

You may:

Study HD wallet structures (BIP32, BIP39, BIP44, BIP49, BIP84).

Learn about secure entropy and deterministic key derivation.

Audit your own wallet implementations safely.

Unauthorized usage against external wallets or live funds is illegal and unethical.

🧰 Suggested Improvements

🧮 Add BIP86 (Taproot) derivation support

💾 Save process checkpoints for resuming after interruption

⚙️ Add CLI arguments (argparse) for configuration

📈 Add logging to CSV or database with timestamps

🔧 Optimize database access with persistent pooled connections
